Main public data API provides programatic access to much the same information (as data) as the web based end user search pages.

Other datasets available are the quarterly statitical resports such as [Incorporated companies in the UK July to September 2025](https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/media/6900d17ba6048928d3fc2b20/Incorporated_companies_in_the_UK_July_to_September_2025.csv) which was used to create
the initial data in [data/quaterly-company-formation.json](data/quaterly-company-formation.json) for a graph.
